# Job Board Web Application

This is a simple job board web application that allows users to view job postings and apply to them. The application also allows users to track their applied jobs and manage them through the "My Applications" page.

## Features
- **Job Listings**: Display job postings with the job title, company, location, and an "Apply Now" button.
- **Application Form**: Users can apply for jobs by submitting their name and email.
- **My Applications**: A page that lists the jobs a user has applied for. Users can remove jobs from this list.
- **Local Storage**: The application stores the user's applied jobs in `localStorage` to persist data across sessions.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling of the job board and application pages.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity, such as applying for jobs and managing the applied jobs list.
- **localStorage**: Used to store and persist the applied job data.
